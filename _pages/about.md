I'm a Research Assistant at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, working in the Computer Science department. My advisors are [Don Porter](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~porter/) and [Andrew Kwong](https://andrewkwong.org). Additionally, I will be serving as the Instructor of Record for COMP 550-002: Algorithms and Analysis in Spring 2025.

My research interests are in Computer Science Education (CSEd) and security. In CSEd, I'm interested in building new tools to give programming students immediate feedback, as well as coming up with techniques to challenge students' understanding of programming concepts in a post-generative AI world. In security, I enjoy making things "break"--input form edge cases, hardware exploits, you name it, I've probably tried poking a hole in it.

Outside of work, I enjoy horror movies, tennis, and living out my dreams of being a chef...on a collegiate budget.
