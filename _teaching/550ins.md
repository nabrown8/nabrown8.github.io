### Post-Mortem

I served as Instructor of Record for COMP 550: Algorithms and Analysis during the Spring 2025 term at UNC Chapel-Hill. I hope to eventually port the slides/notes/lectures used in the course here, so that they may serve as supplemental resources for students taking the course in the future. In the meantime, if you'd like a copy of my notes/slides for a particular topic, feel free to email me.

### Course Information

There is no required textbook for this course. However, a supplemental book that I strongly recommend is *Introduction to Algorithms* (4th ed.), by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein. This book is the gold standard for algorithms courses, and for good reason. It's got lots of examples, goes into far more depth than two weekly meetings could cover, and is written so that each chapter is self-sufficient. Students have access to this textbook for free through UNC's partnership with Ebook Central. It can be found at [this link](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/unc/detail.action?docID=6925615&pq-origsite=summon). (You'll need to login to ProQuest with your ONYEN to access it.)
