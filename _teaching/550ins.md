The textbook for this course will be *Introduction to Algorithms* (4th ed.), by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein. This book is the gold standard for algorithms courses, and for good reason. It's got lots of examples, goes into far more depth than two weekly meetings could cover, and is written so that each chapter is self-sufficient. Students have access to this textbook for free through UNC's partnership with Ebook Central. It can be found at [this link](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/unc/detail.action?docID=6925615&pq-origsite=summon). (You'll need to login to ProQuest with your ONYEN to access it.)

Things planned to come: syllabus, schedule, assignments, etc...once I figure out how Jekyll works, or ditch the theme altogether?
